# Classification of Carotid Plaques based on Features extracted from Ultrasound Images: A Comparative Study

The extraction of multiple hand-crafted features from ultrasound images of carotid plaques can be used to effectively differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques. The aim of this study is to review a wide variety of features sets and evaluate on a common dataset using machine learning methods. Thirty-three feature sets including textural, morphological, histogram-based, multi-scale and moment-based features are extracted from the manually segmented plaque images. For the classification task, the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Random Forest (RF) machine learning classifiers are used on a Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) policy on the extracted features. The results on a dataset of 85 carotid plaques (41 asymptomatic and 44 symptomatic) shows that the classification is feasible and the highest accuracy achieved is 92.94%.
